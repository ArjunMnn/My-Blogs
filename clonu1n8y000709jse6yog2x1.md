## Introduction 🚀

In the world of programming, data is king. How we organize and categorize this data is crucial for efficient processing and manipulation. Python, a versatile and powerful programming language, provides a rich set of built-in data types and structures to help us achieve this. 🛠️

## Data Types 📊

Data types in Python serve as classifications or categorizations of data items. They dictate what operations can be performed on a particular piece of data. Since everything in Python is treated as an object, data types are essentially classes, and variables become instances of these classes. 🧬

Python offers a diverse set of built-in data types:

* Numeric (Integers, complex numbers, and floating-point numbers) 🔢
    
* Sequential (Strings, lists, and tuples) 🧵📜
    
* Boolean 🅿️
    
* Set 🧮
    
* Dictionaries, and more. 📚
    

Determining the data type of a variable is as simple as using the `type()` function:

```python
your_variable = 100
print(type(your_variable))
```

## Data Structures 🏗️

Data structures are the bedrock upon which programs are built. They provide a systematic way of organizing data for efficient access. Python makes learning about these structures more intuitive compared to other languages. 🏗️

### Lists 📋

Lists in Python are akin to arrays in other languages. They are ordered collections of data, offering high flexibility as they can hold elements of different types. 📊

### Tuples 🔄

Tuples, like lists, are collections of Python objects. However, they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be added or removed once created. 🔒

### Dictionaries 📖

Dictionaries function as hash tables, with a time complexity of O(1) for most operations. They are an unordered collection of key-value pairs, making them highly optimized for storage and retrieval of data. 📚

## Tasks 📝

### 1\. Difference between List, Tuple, and Set 🔄📋🧮

* **List**: Ordered collection, mutable, can contain elements of different types. 📋
    
* **Tuple**: Ordered collection, immutable, can contain elements of different types. 🔄
    
* **Set**: Unordered collection, mutable, contains only unique elements. 🧮
    

### 2\. Hands-On with Dictionary Methods 🛠️

```python
fav_tools = {
  1: "Linux",
  2: "Git",
  3: "Docker",
  4: "Kubernetes",
  5: "Terraform",
  6: "Ansible",
  7: "Chef"
}

favorite_tool_key = 2
favorite_tool = fav_tools.get(favorite_tool_key)
print(f"My favorite tool is {favorite_tool}")
```

### 3\. Creating a List of Cloud Service Providers ☁️

```python
cloud_providers = ["AWS", "GCP", "Azure"]
```

### 4\. Adding Digital Ocean and Sorting the List 🌊

```python
cloud_providers.append("Digital Ocean")
cloud_providers.sort()
```

## Conclusion 🌟

Understanding data types and structures is foundational in programming. Python's comprehensive set of built-in data types and structures provide a powerful toolkit for organizing and manipulating data. By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to tackle a wide range of programming tasks efficiently and effectively. Happy coding! 🚀🐍
