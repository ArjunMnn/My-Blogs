Welcome to Day 35 of #90daysofDevOps! Today, we're delving into the realm of ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes. These powerful tools allow you to manage configuration data and sensitive information, providing a robust solution for deploying applications. Let's dive into the tasks!

## Introduction to ConfigMaps and Secrets

In the intricate dance of orchestrating containerized applications, ConfigMaps and Secrets emerge as unsung heroes. **ConfigMaps** provide a flexible way to manage configuration data, while **Secrets** enhance security by safeguarding sensitive information. Together, they empower Kubernetes deployments with resilience and versatility.

## Task 1: Creating a ConfigMap for Your Deployment

### What are ConfigMaps?

**ConfigMaps** in Kubernetes provide a way to decouple configuration artifacts from image content, keeping containerized applications portable. They store key-value pairs of configuration data that can be used by Pods in the cluster.

### Step 1: ConfigMap Creation

Create a ConfigMap for your Deployment using a file or the command line. Open a new file, `configmap.yml`, and add the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: todo-app-config
data:
  DATABASE_URL: "your_database_url"
  API_KEY: "your_api_key"
```

### Step 2: Updating Deployment YAML

Update your `deployment.yml` file to include the ConfigMap. Add the `envFrom` field under `spec.containers`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: todo-deployment
  labels:
    app: todo-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: todo-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: todo-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: todo-app
        image: trainwithshubham/django-todo:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: todo-app-config
```

### Step 3: Applying and Verifying

Apply the updated deployment configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n <namespace-name>
```

Verify that the ConfigMap has been created:

```bash
kubectl get configmaps -n <namespace-name>
```

## Task 2: Creating a Secret for Your Deployment

### What are Secrets?

**Secrets** in Kubernetes are intended to store and manage sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and tokens. They enhance security by allowing the encryption of sensitive data at rest.

### Step 1: Secret Creation

Create a Secret for your Deployment using a file or the command line. Open a new file, `secret.yml`, and add the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: todo-app-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: YWRtaW4xMjM=  # Base64-encoded "admin123"
```

### Step 2: Updating Deployment YAML

Update your `deployment.yml` file to include the Secret. Add the `envFrom` field under `spec.containers`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: todo-deployment
  labels:
    app: todo-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: todo-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: todo-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: todo-app
        image: trainwithshubham/django-todo:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: todo-app-secret
```

### Step 3: Applying and Verifying

Apply the updated deployment configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n <namespace-name>
```

Verify that the Secret has been created:

```bash
kubectl get secrets -n <namespace-name>
```

## Conclusion

ConfigMaps and Secrets stand as indispensable allies in the realm of Kubernetes, offering a dynamic duo of configuration management and security enhancement. By mastering these tools, you've unlocked the potential to elevate your deployments with resilience and safeguard sensitive information.
